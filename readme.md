# Horiseon Marketing Agency's Website
The goal of this project was to refactor the given website of
Horiseon Marketing Agency and to make sure that this website follows accesibility standards. This was inorder to optimize this site for search engines. 

To do so, I have implemented HTML Semantics and have also included alternate text to the images provided to me. I also made the background image match the mock up in regards to how the image was slighty more zoomed out. 

*What the site should look like*
