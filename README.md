# Horiseon Marketing Agency's Website
The goal of this project was to refactor the given website of
Horiseon Marketing Agency and to make sure that this website follows accesibility standards. This was inorder to optimize this site for search engines. 

To do so, I have implemented HTML Semantics and have also included alternate text to the images provided to me.
